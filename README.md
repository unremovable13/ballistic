# Unremovable
Ballistic re-upload
(SOME OFFSETS ARENT UP TO DATE! THIS IS JUST CODE ARCHIVE)

NOTE: I have updated some of the offsets, however there are still a couple of offsets I couldn't get my hands on, so not all of them are updated.


IN CASE THIS GETS REMOVED HERE ARE THE ARCHIVE AND DOWNLOAD LINKS:

[Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20241105172756/https://github.com/unremovable13/ballistic)
[Download 1 Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/2f7ddy.zip)
[Download 2 Hidan.sh](https://hidan.sh/25kt09i52dof)


I advise that you download this repo just in case it gets removed, or save the link somewhere so you can look at the web archive and the download links.


This was written by (0Zayn), and Ethan (ethanmcdonagh), and given the code name Ballistic, many upcoming new executors have been using this module, including but not limited to Artemis, Athena, Atlantis, and Protoware (NOTE: Protoware did not even have our permission, and claimed it was theirs).
Due to all this I have decided to leak the source to hopefully put a stop, and be able to have credit for our work.

Please feel free to do whatever with this, just not distribute it as your own product
